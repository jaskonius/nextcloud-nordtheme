# nextcloud-nordtheme
[Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com) settings for nextcloud. Requires [custom css](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/theming_customcss) plugin.
Copy paste values under 'Settings > Theming'.

Work in progress tho, doing this along the way when working with nextcloud.

## Status
Apparently, there are actually people taking a look from time to time. Thing is, I don't use Nextcloud anymore (at least at the moment). So yeah, if you find colours in a real ugly aqua tone, just either fix it yourself or drop a short issue and I'll apply it. Tyvm, peace out.
